Conclusions
People with higher income are likely to get higher interest rates on loans.
Higher interest rates on loan will lead to the loan not paid on due dates and possibly defaulters
Most loans which were charged off were taken to pay debts
Higher amount of loans were verified more than less amount, thus loans with lesser amount are more liekely to be charged off.
